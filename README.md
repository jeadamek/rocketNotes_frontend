# RocketNotes App

This project was developed on Stage 9 in the Explorer course at the [Rocketseat School](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). To access the entire course assignments click [this link](https://github.com/jeadamek/explorer-rocketseat). 


The RocketNotes App is a web application built with Reactjs that allows users to create and store notes and links securely. Users can create their own login credentials, update their profile information, and retrieve or delete their saved notes as needed.

This application is a component of a larger project whose API was developed in Stage 8. You can access the repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/jeadamek/rocketNotes_api), and it will be completed in the next stage of the course.

I could practice and study:

- Use Vite to start and structure the project;
- Style and format application with Styled Components;
- Hooks User authentication;
- Build an application using ReactJS components;
- Navigation with React Router Dom;
- Data immutability;
- Promises with Async Await;
- Route mapping;
- Asynchronous and promises;
- Object orientation;
- Data types in javascript;
- Functions Callbacks;
- Context API;
- ES6 Modules;
